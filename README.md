# ETL - Extract, Transform, and Load

In this module, we're utilizing a popular data integration process known as ETL to effectively extract crowdfunding data, transform it so it's useful/relevant for an analytics team or particular indivduals to sift through, and load into an SQL database so queries can be made. 

Specifically, we're assisting Independent Funding, an imaginary crowdfunding platform for funding independent project or ventures. As they're a growing organization, they need to transition their accessible data to a dedicated database.
